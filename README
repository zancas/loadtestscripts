Prerequisites:

* a tahoe executable on the invoking shell's PATH
* a running tahoe node that has been introduced to a storage server using the backend you want to test
* a webserver running on that node connected to 127.0.0.1:3456
* the "matplotlib" graphing library

Given the above:

  To test the effect of putting "N" larger than 56 bytes immutables to the grid run:

   ./fileputter.py N  <---  We've been running N = 10000

  To produce a png showing the results of your test:

  (0) Wait 'til the test finishes.
  (1) See that there's a new new subdirectory of PWD named "Seconds_Since_the_Epoch"
  (2) run:

   ./simplerttgrapher.py "Seconds_Since_the_Epoch"

  (3) Find a file named: "Round_Trip_Times.png" in the "Seconds_Since_the_Epoch" directory.

  To test the effect of putting "N" strings to a single mutable file on the grid:

  (0) Extract a write cap for a mutable file from the tahoe WUI by selecting "SDMF" radio button, and "Upload", and then copying the long suffix string from the end of "URI:SSK:" to the end.  We'll call this MUTCAP.

  (1) run:

     "./fileputter.py N --mutable 'MUTCAP'"

  (2) visualize in in the same way as for the immutable tests.
